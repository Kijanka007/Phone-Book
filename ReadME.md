## ðŸ”‘ Key Functions

### `write_file(file_name, data)`
- Saves the given `data` (list) into a JSON file.  
- Uses `json.dumps` to convert Python objects into JSON strings.

```python
write_file("phone_num.json", [{"name": "alice", "num": 123}])
```
---
### `read_file(file_name)`
- Reads a JSON file and returns it as a Python object (`list`/`dict`).  
- Used to load the contacts when the app starts.

```python
phone_data = read_file("phone_num.json")
```
---
### `display_all_contact(phone_data)`
- Prints all contacts in the phone book.  
- Loops through the list of contacts and shows each one.
---
### `display_contact_by_name(contact_to_display, phone_data)`
- Searches for a contact by name.  
- Prints the contact if it exists.  
- Prints `"Name not found."` if no match is found.

---
### `check_already_exist(name_to_add, phone_data)`
- Checks if the given name already exists in the phone book.  
- Returns `True` if the name exists, otherwise `False`.  
- Used internally by `add_contact`.

---
### `add_contact(name_to_add, number_to_add, phone_data)`
- Adds a new contact if it doesnâ€™t already exist.  
- Writes the updated list back into the JSON file.  
- If the contact already exists, prints `"Contact already exists."`.
---
### `delete_contact(name_to_delete, phone_data)`
- Deletes a contact by name.  
- Returns the updated list without the deleted contact.  
- If the name is not found, prints `"Name not found."`.
---
### `update_contact(contact_to_update, phone_data, number_or_name)`
- Updates either the **name** or the **number** of an existing contact.  
- Prompts the user to enter the new value.  
- Saves the updated contacts back into the JSON file.  
- If the name doesnâ€™t exist, prints `"Name not found."`.
